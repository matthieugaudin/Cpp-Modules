## Project Overview

The C++ modules are part of the 42 curriculum. The objective is to understand the concepts of the **OOP paradigm** using **C++98 standards**.  


## Project Structure

Each C++ module contains several directories corresponding to the exercises to complete.  
For each exercise, there is a **Makefile** to compile it.  


## Conclusion

I completed 4 modules out of the 8 in the curriculum during my reorientation into **BUT GEII**.  
These modules taught me the basic concepts of OOP, including:  

- Classes and inheritance  
- The diamond problem  
- Standard classes (`std`)  
- Setters and getters  
- Constructors and destructors  
- Memory management  
- References and pointers  
- Methods and the `this` keyword  
- File operations  
- Operator overloading  
- Basics of abstract classes and interfaces

These exercises helped me build a solid foundation in C++ object-oriented programming.
